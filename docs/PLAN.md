### 2025-06-27 Session 4 - Architecture Implementation
- **Major Architecture Overhaul**: Implemented comprehensive Clean Architecture + Repository Pattern
- Added critical dependencies: Riverpod, Dio, Dartz, Logger, Image processing libraries
- Created core infrastructure:

  - Repository interface with clean contracts
  - Use cases for capture, gallery selection, and photo management
- Created data layer implementation:
  - PhotoModel with JSON serialization
  - Local data source with image processing and validation
  - Repository implementation with proper error mapping
- Integrated Riverpod state management:
  - Provider-based dependency injection
  - State notifier for photo operations
  - Clean separation of concerns
