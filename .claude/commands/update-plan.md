4. **Modify the "Ready for next session" line** to reflect the next logical step
5. **Update any "In Progress" or "Upcoming Tasks" sections** as needed
6. **Add any new insights or technical decisions** discovered during the work

## When to Use
- After implementing new features
- After major refactoring or architecture changes
